# Health-Recommendation-System-Using-Parallel-Processing-and-Distributed-File-Systems
<ol>
<li>A Recommendation System which uses machine learning model classifier to predict patients with high susceptibility index ( a measure indicating the susceptibility of a patient to a heart attack )using features like Chest Pain, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure etc.</li>
<li>Since the dataset was very large, it was stored on a distributed file system like hdfs and parallel processing was done using pyspark to reduce processing time.</li>
<li><strong>Technologies:</strong> Cluster creation, Pyspark, HDFS, SpringBoot, MySQL</li>
</ol>
